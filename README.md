Model order reduction using Dynamic Mode Decomposition :Application to the Anaerobic Digestion Model N.1 (ADM1)
In this repository I would like to share with you my work on the order reduction of the ADM1 model of anaerobic digestion using the famous DMD method. Ihave apply the DMD method to a set of data generated from the simulation of the AMD1 diffential equations.
