Model order reduction using Dynamic Mode Decomposition :Application to the Anaerobic Digestion Model N.1 (ADM1)
In this repository I would like to share with you my work on the order reduction of the ADM1 model of anaerobic digestion using the famous DMD method. Ihave apply the DMD method to a set of data generated from the simulation of the AMD1 diffential equations. 
This work has been published in the CARI2020 conference  in the following link: https://www.cari-info.org/senegal-2020/ or ypu can find the paper in the HAL archive here: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02928872v1.
